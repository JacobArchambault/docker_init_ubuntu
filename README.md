# Docker install script
The bash script in this repository can be used to install docker on an Ubuntu server. 

To run, ssh into the Ubuntu server you want to install docker on. Then run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobArchambault/docker_init_ubuntu/master/docker_init.sh > docker_init.sh` to pull the text into a shell file: this file installs and enables docker, then adds a shell user named `cloud_user` to the docker group. If the user you want to give docker permissions to has a different name, substitute that name for 'cloud_user' in the script. Run the script with `bash docker_init.sh`. Lastly, exit the server, then ssh back in as the user that you've just added to the docker group, and run `docker run hello-world` to ensure that docker is able to properly pull and run images.
